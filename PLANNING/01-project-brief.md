# Project Brief

## Project Name
**Organized AI Marketplace**

Forked from: [claude-code-templates](https://github.com/davila7/claude-code-templates)
Repository: [OAI-marketplace](https://github.com/Organized-AI/OAI-marketplace)
Website: [aitmpl.com](https://www.aitmpl.com)

## Vision Statement
*In one sentence, describe what success looks like for this project*

Create the most comprehensive, community-driven marketplace for Claude Code configurations, enabling developers to achieve "deep coding at terminal velocity" through ready-to-use AI agents, integrations, and development workflows.

## Problem Statement
*What specific problem are you solving? Who experiences this problem?*

**The Problem:**
Developers using Claude Code face three major friction points:
1. **Configuration Complexity** - Setting up Claude Code with the right agents, MCPs, hooks, and commands requires deep technical knowledge and significant time investment
2. **Discovery Challenge** - Finding quality Claude Code components, templates, and integrations is difficult without a centralized, searchable marketplace
3. **Integration Overhead** - Connecting Claude Code with external services (GitHub, AWS, Stripe, OpenAI, etc.) requires manual configuration and authentication setup

**Who Experiences It:**
- **Primary users**: Developers using Anthropic's Claude Code for AI-assisted development
- **Secondary users**: Development teams wanting to standardize their Claude Code setups
- **Context**: Early-stage projects, rapid prototyping, enterprise development environments where consistent AI tooling is critical

## Target Audience

### Primary Users
- **Demographics**: Professional developers, AI engineers, full-stack developers using Claude Code
- **Behavior**: Active Claude Code users looking to enhance productivity with pre-built configurations
- **Motivations**:
  - Reduce time spent configuring AI tools
  - Discover best-in-class agents and integrations
  - Share and reuse proven Claude Code setups across projects
- **Pain Points**:
  - Manual setup of MCPs (Model Context Protocol integrations) is tedious
  - Creating custom agents from scratch requires experimentation
  - No central repository for community-contributed Claude Code resources

### Secondary Users
- **Stakeholders**: Development team leads, CTOs wanting standardized AI development practices
- **Influencers**: Developer advocates, AI tool creators, open-source contributors

### Out of Scope (What We're NOT Building)
- [ ] **Claude Code Core Development**: We're building on top of Anthropic's Claude Code, not replacing it
- [ ] **Paid Marketplace**: All components remain free and MIT-licensed (monetization via sponsorships/premium support only)
- [ ] **Custom AI Models**: We use Claude Code's existing models, not training new ones
- [ ] **IDE Plugins**: Focus on CLI/web tools, not VS Code extensions (Phase 4+)

### Future Considerations
- [ ] **Version 2**:
  - AI-powered component recommendations based on project type
  - Automated testing framework for community-contributed components
  - Enterprise team management (private component sharing)
- [ ] **Long-term Vision**:
  - Become the npm/PyPI equivalent for Claude Code configurations
  - Support for other AI coding assistants (GitHub Copilot, Cursor, etc.)
  - Integration marketplace with revenue sharing for component creators

## Risk Assessment

### Technical Risks
- **Risk 1**: Component compatibility issues across Claude Code versions
  - *Mitigation*: Version pinning, automated compatibility testing, clear deprecation warnings
- **Risk 2**: npm registry outages blocking component installations
  - *Mitigation*: Fallback to GitHub releases, local caching mechanism
- **Risk 3**: API rate limits from external services (GitHub, Stripe APIs in MCPs)
  - *Mitigation*: Document rate limit best practices, implement exponential backoff

### Business Risks
- **Market Risk**: Low adoption if Claude Code user base is too small
  - *Mitigation*: Engage with Anthropic's developer community early, cross-promote with related tools
- **Competition Risk**: Anthropic launches official marketplace
  - *Mitigation*: Build strong community early, focus on extensibility and unique features
- **Sustainability Risk**: Open-source burnout, lack of maintainer time
  - *Mitigation*: Build governance model, recruit co-maintainers from community contributors

### Resource Risks
- **Time Risk**: 12-week timeline is aggressive for marketplace features
  - *Mitigation*: Start with MVP (CLI + basic web UI), defer advanced features to post-launch iterations
- **Skill Risk**: Limited frontend development experience
  - *Mitigation*: Use AI coding assistants (Claude Code, GitHub Copilot), leverage UI component libraries (shadcn/ui, Tailwind)
