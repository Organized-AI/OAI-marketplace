# Requirements Specification

## Overview
This document outlines the functional and non-functional requirements for the **Organized AI Marketplace**. The primary focus is the **Stack Builder** - a visual interface for composing Claude Code configurations, along with supporting marketplace infrastructure.

**Project Context**:
- Forked from [claude-code-templates](https://github.com/davila7/claude-code-templates)
- Goal: Create the most comprehensive, community-driven marketplace for Claude Code
- Priority Feature: Stack Builder (visual component composer)

---

## Functional Requirements

### Core Features (Must Have - Phase 1)

#### Feature 1: Stack Builder - Visual Component Composer
**Description**: A drag-and-drop web interface that allows developers to visually compose Claude Code configurations by selecting agents, MCPs, commands, hooks, settings, and templates. Think "Stackblitz for AI tooling" - users can preview, test, and export complete Claude Code setups without writing configuration files manually.

**User Stories**:
- As a **Claude Code developer**, I want to visually browse and select components so that I don't have to manually edit configuration files
- As a **team lead**, I want to create standardized "stacks" for my team so that everyone has consistent Claude Code setups
- As a **new user**, I want to discover what's possible with Claude Code so that I can learn about available agents and integrations

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] **AC1**: User can drag components from a categorized sidebar into a canvas area
- [ ] **AC2**: Selected components display their configuration options (API keys, settings, parameters)
- [ ] **AC3**: System validates compatibility between selected components (e.g., PostgreSQL MCP requires database credentials)
- [ ] **AC4**: User can preview the generated `.claude/` folder structure before export
- [ ] **AC5**: User can export stack as:
  - ZIP file with complete `.claude/` configuration
  - npm install command (`npx claude-code-templates@latest --agents=X --mcps=Y`)
  - Git repository template (via `degit` or similar)
- [ ] **AC6**: Stack Builder saves in-progress work to browser localStorage
- [ ] **AC7**: User can share stack via URL (e.g., `aitmpl.com/stack/abc123`)
- [ ] **AC8**: Mobile-responsive design (usable on tablet, read-only on phone)

**Priority**: **CRITICAL** | **Complexity**: 5/5 | **Effort**: 80 hours (2 weeks)

**Dependencies**:
- Component metadata API (agent/MCP descriptions, parameters, compatibility rules)
- Frontend framework decision (Next.js vs React SPA)
- Design system (Tailwind + shadcn/ui recommended)

**Technical Notes**:
```javascript
// Example Stack Builder data structure
{
  "stackId": "abc123",
  "name": "Full-Stack AI Development",
  "description": "Complete setup for building web apps with Claude Code",
  "components": {
    "agents": ["react-specialist", "security-auditor"],
    "mcps": ["github", "supabase", "stripe"],
    "commands": ["/generate-tests", "/optimize-bundle"],
    "hooks": ["pre-commit-review"],
    "settings": {
      "model": "claude-opus-4",
      "maxTokens": 100000
    }
  },
  "configuration": {
    "GITHUB_TOKEN": "{{user_input}}",
    "SUPABASE_URL": "{{user_input}}",
    "STRIPE_API_KEY": "{{user_input}}"
  }
}
```
