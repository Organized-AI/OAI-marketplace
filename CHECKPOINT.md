## 🔧 TODO: Implementation Needed

### Priority 1: Complete Installation Logic
**Location:** [claude-integration.js:45](claude-integration.js#L45)

```javascript
async installSkill(component) {
    // TODO(human): Implement skill installation logic
    // Skills are stored in .claude/skills/<skill-name>/
    // Each skill has a SKILL.md file with instructions

    const skillPath = `${this.config.skillsDir}/${component.id}`;

    // YOUR TASK: Add actual file system operations here
    // 1. Create directory structure
    // 2. Download/copy component files
    // 3. Set up configuration
    // 4. Validate installation

    return {
        success: true,
        message: `Skill ${component.name} installed to ${skillPath}`,
        path: skillPath,
        component: component.name
    };
}
```

**Options:**
- **Option A:** Use Node.js backend with Express to handle installations
- **Option B:** Use browser File System Access API (requires user permission)
- **Option C:** Generate downloadable installation scripts
- **Option D:** Create npm/npx package for CLI installation

### Priority 2: Component Detail Modal
**Location:** [app.js:453](app.js#L453)

```javascript
function viewComponentDetails(componentId) {
    // TODO(human): Implement modal or detail view
    // This could show full component details, installation instructions,
    // dependencies, and a preview of what will be installed

    // YOUR TASK: Create a modal that displays:
    // - Full description
    // - Installation steps
    // - Dependencies
    // - Source file preview
    // - Direct install button
}
```

**Guidance:** Use HTML `<dialog>` element for native modal behavior or build custom overlay.

### Priority 3: Real Download Counts
Currently using random numbers for downloads. To get real data:

1. **Option A:** Track in database (requires backend)
2. **Option B:** Use GitHub API to get file access stats
3. **Option C:** Parse npm download counts if packages are published
4. **Option D:** Use analytics platform like PostHog or Plausible

### Priority 4: Add "Skills" and "Plugins" Categories
The current extraction only processes:
- agents, commands, settings, hooks, mcps

**Need to add:**
- Skills (if they exist in the repo)
- Plugins (if they exist in the repo)

Update `COMPONENT_PATHS` in [extract-components.js](scripts/extract-components.js) to include these.

## 🐛 Known Issues & Limitations

### Current Limitations
1. ⚠️ **No Real Installation** - Scripts are generated but not executed
2. ⚠️ **Random Download Counts** - Not tracking actual usage
3. ⚠️ **No User Accounts** - Everyone sees the same data
4. ⚠️ **No Persistence** - Stack resets on page reload (except URL sharing)
5. ⚠️ **Missing Plugins/Skills** - Categories not yet extracted
6. ⚠️ **No Component Ratings** - Can't rate or review components
7. ⚠️ **No Search History** - Recent searches not saved

### Edge Cases
- Some components may have incomplete descriptions (using filename fallback)
- Company detection is keyword-based (may misclassify some components)
- Tags are auto-generated from content (may miss some relevant tags)
- Icons are category-based (all components in subcategory share icon)

## 💡 Key Insights

`★ Insight ─────────────────────────────────────`
The **data extraction pipeline** demonstrates a powerful pattern: using git as a data source. By parsing the upstream repository directly, we avoid maintaining duplicate data and can update the marketplace simply by re-running the extraction script. This is similar to how documentation sites like Docusaurus work - they generate static sites from markdown files in git repositories.
`─────────────────────────────────────────────────`

`★ Insight ─────────────────────────────────────`
The marketplace uses a **hybrid architecture**: static frontend with dynamic data. The HTML/CSS/JS is served statically (fast, cheap, scalable), but the data comes from automated extraction. This gives us the best of both worlds - the performance of static sites with the flexibility of dynamic data. We can add a backend later for features that need it (user accounts, real-time tracking) without rebuilding the frontend.

## 📞 Questions for Tomorrow

1. **Installation Strategy**
   - Should we build a CLI tool (like `npx organized-ai install`)?
   - Or keep it browser-based with download scripts?
   - Do we need user authentication for installations?

2. **Data Updates**
   - How often should we re-run extraction (daily, weekly)?
   - Should we cache data or always fetch fresh?
   - Do we need a webhook from upstream repo?

3. **Missing Categories**
   - Are there "skills" and "plugins" in the repo?
   - Should we create synthetic categories?
   - How to handle uncategorized components?

4. **Monetization (Future)**
   - Keep 100% free and open source?
   - Premium components?
   - Sponsored listings?
   - Enterprise features?
